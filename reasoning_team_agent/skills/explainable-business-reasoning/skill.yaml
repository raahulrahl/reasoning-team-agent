  overview: |
    A reasoning team that orchestrates specialized agents to handle complex queries.
    The team leader uses reasoning tools to plan and delegate tasks to web search and finance agents,
    then synthesizes their findings into structured, auditable insights.

  use_cases:
    when_to_use:
      - "Complex queries requiring multiple data sources"
      - "Financial research and market analysis"
      - "Tasks needing transparent reasoning process"

    when_not_to_use:
      - "Simple single-source queries"
      - "Real-time trading decisions"
      - "Tasks requiring domain-specific proprietary data"

  input_structure: |
    Messages array with role and content:

    [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Your query here"}
    ]

    Constraints:
    - Text or JSON format
    - Natural language queries
    - Supports multi-turn conversations

  output_format: |
    Structured response with reasoning steps and findings:

    {
      "content": "Synthesized analysis with sources",
      "reasoning_steps": ["Step 1", "Step 2"],
      "sources": ["URL1", "URL2"]
    }

  error_handling:
    - "API key validation on startup"
    - "MCP server connection failures handled gracefully"
    - "30-second timeout for MCP connections"
    - "Partial failure support for unavailable servers"

  examples:
    - title: "Financial Analysis Query"
      input:
        role: "user"
        content: "Analyze Tesla's Q4 performance"
      output:
        content: "Detailed analysis with market data and sources"
        reasoning: "Multi-step analysis process"

    - title: "Market Research Query"
      input:
        role: "user"
        content: "Compare renewable energy investments"
      output:
        content: "Comparative analysis with financial metrics"
        sources: ["cnbc.com", "reuters.com"]

  best_practices:
    for_developers:
      - "Initialize MCP tools before agent startup"
      - "Use lazy initialization for first request"
      - "Enable response caching for model calls"
      - "Clean up MCP connections on shutdown"

    for_orchestrators:
      - "Route complex multi-source queries to this skill"
      - "Chain with data analysis skills for deeper insights"
      - "Consider 10 max concurrent requests limit"
      - "Monitor MCP server health and connectivity"
